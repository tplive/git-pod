The idea of the `git pod` is a sort of livestream/podcast/thing where I get together with one or two people each time, and we go through some part of the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) which is available for free. And then just talk through and show off some part of Git, hopefully learning new stuff along the way.

If the guest(s) are experts, ask all the questions in a way that the expert can explain. Don't leave a topic until it is clearly understood.

I want to cover the entire book, but may not find it convenient to go through each chapter sequentially, rather I would like to skip back and forth a bit. I want to use this repo to plan and document the execution of the series.

# The Plan

So the plan is subject to extensive review, but right now looks like this:
No. - (chapter reference) - Title

## Episode 0 - Intro

"Hi. I'm Thomas, and in this series we will learn about Git. Each episode I'll take a tour around some chapter from the 'Pro Git' book, which is available online to read for free, so you don't really need this series, do you? So _another_ git tutorial?? Why? Well, because it's a tool I as a developer use every single day, and I want to learn more about it. And I wanted to share what I learned along the way. Since I'm no expert, I'll invite friends to show-n-tell a particular git topic. It'll get very technical, but that is where I cut in and start asking the silly questions. We won't leave a topic until it's well and clearly understood."

"You can just watch and listen, or you can follow along, in which case you will need to have a computer with _any_ operating system (we exclude nobody!) as Git is very available across all platforms. Don't worry, we will start out by installing Git."

## Episode 1 - Getting Started

1. (1.1) What is version control and why do we need it?
