The idea of the `git pod` is a sort of livestream/podcast/thing where I get together with one or two people each time, and we go through some part of the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) which is available for free. And then just talk through and show off some part of Git, hopefully learning new stuff along the way.

I want to cover the entire book, but may not find it convenient to go through each chapter sequentially, rather I would like to skip back and forth a bit. I want to use this repo to plan and document the execution of the series.

# The Plan
So the plan is subject to extensive review, but right now looks like this:
No. - (chapter reference) - Title

1. (1.1) What is version control and why do we need it?
1. (1.5) Installing Git
1. (8.1) Customizing Git

# Later
Some later stages that are due for inclusion:
- Git signing with GPG
- Conditional Git configuration
